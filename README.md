Natural Gas Price Detection Using Machine Learning Model

Introduction

Overview

Forecasting natural gas prices is a powerful and essential tool which has become more important for different stakeholders in the natural gas market, allowing them to make better decisions for managing the potential risk, reducing the gap between the demand and supply, and optimising the usage of resources based on accurate predictions.

Purposed

Accurate natural gas price forecasting not only provides an important guide for effective implementation of energy policy and planning, but also is extremely significant in economic planning, energy investment, and environmental conservation. The aim of this project is to build data-driven machine learning models for natural gas price forecasting.

Literature Survey

Existing Problem
The poor track record of energy price forecasting models has encouraged analysts to turn to other sources of information about future energy prices, including most prominently, energy futures markets. Energy futures markets are 'hubs' that price and market natural gas. Walls (1995), examining several years of spot prices finds that, in general, gas futures are unbiased predictors of future spot prices whereas Herbet (1993) finds bias in natural gas futures prices where futures prices are greater than realised spot prices. Chinn et al (2005) finds futures prices to be unbiased predictors of future spot prices, with the exception of those in the natural gas market at the three month horizon and they slightly outperform time series models.

Proposed Solution
Using the data set of prices provided from the 7th of January 1997 until 11th of august 2020, we will be trying to predict the prices of natural gas by testing through various machine learning models and providing a real-time web based GUI to ask the user to enter the desired date to predict the rate of the natural gas on that particular day. This study builds upon the existing literature by investigating the accuracy of various forecast methods until the best fit horizon is reached.
Software Designing
We will be using the following modules and softwares to help build the project:

pandas 1.2.4
matplotlib~ 3.4.2
pydotplus~=2.0.2
six~ 1.15.0
ipython~ 7.24.1
scikit-learn~=0.24.2
seaborn~=0.11.1
scipy~=1.6.3
Jupyter Notebook
Spyder
IBM Watson Cloud along with Machine Learning module.
And for Deployment into internet we have used Azure.
